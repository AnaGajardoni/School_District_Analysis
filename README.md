# School_District_Analysis

## Overview
Maria, a chief data scientist for a school district, is responsible for analysing information. In this task, she needs to analyse test data in order to help understand performance trends and patterns. Such study will help the school board and the superintendent in budgeting and priorities. 
* The main task is to agregate data (respecting Ferpa - Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act) providing various views on performance taking into account parameters like school type, size, budget per student, etc.
* A second task is to analyse the impact on numbers if a given subset of data is removed from the analysis. It was reported that the scores of Thomas High School 9th grade were not reliable, that there had been some sort of disonesty when reporting data. The idea is to remove this data from the analysis and understand how this removal impacted on the numbers.

## Results
Several approaches were used to analyse data - from more generic to more specific ones. The results are listed below - comparing the discrepancies that aroused from the removal of part of the data.
